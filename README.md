# Wordle
This is a project meant to replicate the popular game Wordle with functions going as follows:
The user will be given 6 chances to guess a 5 letter word, depending on their word one of the following will happen:
If a letter isnt in the correct work at all then it shall become gray to signify such
If a letter from their guess is in the correct word but not in the correct position it will be coloured yellow
If a letter from their guess is in the correct word and in the correct position it will be coloured Green.

If the user can successfully guess the random word by the 6th guess they will win the game

Further functions include:
The ability to sign into an account and to keep track of the users statistics
A settings menu in which the user can set things such as the dark mode
A leaderboard to keep track of the highest number of wins and who it belongs to
